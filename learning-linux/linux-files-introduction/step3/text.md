Now we're getting serious! We can use the read.py as a python script to read from the file 'var/random-cities' if we so please. Delete the file `/var/dont-need-this.png`

<br>

### Solution
Check if the file is there using

```plain
ls /var/dont-need-this.png
```{{exec}}

Now to delete we run

```plain
rm /var/dont-need-this.png
```{{exec}}
