Create a new file named read.py in the new directory you just created `./my-new-file` with content about reading files

<br>

### Solution
We can use the command `nano' and when prompted we can simply write '#Program to read files':

```plain
nano ./my-new-file/read.py
```{{exec}}

And to verify we can run

```plain
cat ./my-new-file/read.py
```{{exec}}
