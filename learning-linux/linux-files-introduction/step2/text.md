Create a new file named random-city.txt in the new directory you just created `./my-new-file` with content about reading files

<br>

### Solution
We can use the command `nano' and when prompted we can simply write a random city of your choosing:

```plain
nano ./my-new-file/random-city.txt
```{{exec}}

And to verify we can run

```plain
cat ./my-new-file/random-city.txt
```{{exec}}

To move into our new directory we can run

```plain
cd my-new-file
```{{exec}}
