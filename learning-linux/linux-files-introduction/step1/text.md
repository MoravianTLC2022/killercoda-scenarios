Create a new empty file called `my-new-file` in your home directory

<br>

### Solution
First we make sure we're in our home directory using

```plain
cd ~
```{{exec}}

We can list the current directory using

```plain
pwd
```{{exec}}

Now we create the file

```plain
 mkdir my-new-file
```{{exec}}
